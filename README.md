# Rentals Group Project Proposal

**Problem domain**: Many students have difficulty finding an affordable place to live with the skyrocketing prices of apartments in the GTA. 
Students often have to look through a variety of websites with different offerings such as Rentals.ca, Kijiji, and the UofT Off-Campus Housing 
Search to find a place to stay; and keep track of communications with landlords across those websites and more. We want to make this 
process simpler for students by creating a single website with all of these listings and more; with the added bonus of selectively 
displaying homes that we know students can afford and will find safe and convenient.


**Description**: We will create a real estate listing browser that is catered toward students living in the GTA. We plan to implement 
features that university students would find helpful, such as property filters based on price range, location, and walkability to amenities 
such as grocery stores, restaurants, recreation, and public transit. This information will be fetched from an API and stored in a database 
from which we will establish a connection to our website and display the data.
