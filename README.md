Basic Overview of Got Room?

Our project is about finding rental listings and making recommendations to users in America, with a greater focus convenience of location. On the home page, listings are displayed in an interactive map, where users can easily see everything in the neighbourhood (eg. grocery stores, transit, restaurants, parks, etc.), and can be filtered based on the userâ€™s preferences (price, number of bedrooms, etc.). Users are also able to simply search for an address, city, or area through the search bar to browse listings in that location on the map. When a user clicks on a listing, it navigates them to the listing page, where all its details will be displayed, such as its price and property type, as well as a section with recommendations for other similar listings. They have the option to create an account and login to save the listing, should they need to come back and revisit the page again.
